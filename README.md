# ArduinoWear
THIS IS THE CODE FOR THE FIREBASE AAND ARDUINO AS USED IN CREATING WEAR APPLICATION. YOU NEED
1. MAX 30102 SENSOR
2. OLED SCREEN
3. BREADBOARD AND JUMPER WIRES
4. BUZZER
5. ARDUINO UNO KIT
6. NODE MCU ESP8266 MICROCONTROLLER.
We get the data from the sensor to the the arduino ide and then the data is sent to the microcintroller which then sends this data to firebase database.
